These two sons initially formed a coalition with a well-known member of the original Mantimahle males, referred to as the 5th Mantimahle. The trio first appeared in Sabi Sands in 2021, confidently moving through the territories of other dominant males before settling just northeast of Sabi Sands. Not much was heard about them until they began appearing more frequently in the region—now without the 5th Mantimahle, who is believed to have passed away. These males closely resemble their fathers, with large, muscular builds and thick manes. One male, in particular, has a very dark mane stretching down to his back and elbows. Their physical strength is matched by an aggressive temperament, making them a formidable challenge to any rival coalition.",

In recent weeks, sightings of the Tumbela male have become increasingly rare, suggesting he may have passed away. The end of the Tumbela coalition seems all but confirmed. Though their time in power was marked by challenges and adversity, they left behind a legacy through the Othawa Pride, which now flourishes under the rule of the Plains Camp males, continuing the Tumbela bloodline.",

Under Majingilane protection, the Othawa Pride experienced relative stability, with strong genetic contributions from the coalition. This era is remembered not only for its impact on lion dynamics in the Greater Kruger area but also for the iconic legacy the Majingilane left behind—fathers, kings, and warriors whose bloodlines still roam the savannas today. From 2014 to 2018, the powerful Majingilane coalition brought stability and growth to the pride. Several cubs were born, including a litter in February 2015 of two males and one female. When their mother was killed by hyenas in January 2016, the cubs were raised by their aunts, demonstrating the strong familial bonds of the pride.

The Matimbas quickly capitalized on this power vacuum, moving into the Othawa Pride’s territory and challenging the Majingilanes. While relatively brief, the Matimba takeover left a lasting impact on the Othawa Pride. Under their leadership, the pride experienced some growth and stability. The Matimbas accepted the offspring of the Majingilane males and fathered a generation of their own, which included two males and a female who later joined the lone Ximunghwe female. The aging Matimba male held onto the pride until early 2021, nearing 15 years of age. The lone Matimba male put up a brave fight against the three Tumbelas and was able to hold the pride for several months as the Tumbelas grew in confidence.

Over the years, the pride has fluctuated in size and composition, with coalitions like the Matimba Males, Birmingham Males, and Avoca Males contributing to its genetic legacy. The Nkuhuma Pride gained global recognition thanks to regular appearances on live safari streams such as WildEarth, allowing viewers to follow generations of lionesses and cubs through dramatic events—coalition takeovers, infanticide, hunts, and survival.

By early 2011, the Matimbas had successfully overthrown dominant males across Manyeleti and surrounding areas, establishing themselves as a formidable force within the Greater Kruger ecosystem. Around this time, the Talamati Pride had returned to the Sabi Sands after several years in Kruger National Park. Upon their return in 2011, the pride, then consisting primarily of two maturing lionesses, Silver-Eye and her sister, came under the control of the Matimba Males. This timing aligned with the Matimbas' broader campaign of territorial expansion and consolidation. Under Matimba rule, Silver-Eye and her sister mated with the coalition and gave birth to several cubs. At least one female and three young male offspring of the Matimbas survived to adulthood. One lioness eventually left the pride, marking the end of the Matimba genetic contribution to the Talamati lineage.",

The younger trio—Dark Mane, Blondie, and Mohawk—dispersed together and eventually became known as the Northern Avoca Males. In early 2018, they encountered the Talamati Pride, which at the time was without pride males following the disappearance of the last Selati Male in 2017. The Northern Avoca Males successfully took over the pride, establishing their dominance and beginning a new breeding chapter for the Talamatis. After the takeover, the three brothers operated more independently. Dark Mane remained with the Talamati Pride, maintaining a consistent presence, while Blondie and Mohawk shifted their focus to the Nkuhuma Pride in northern Sabi Sands. In 2019, Dark Mane sustained an injury to his right paw. The wound failed to heal properly, resulting in a permanent limp. Despite this limitation, Dark Mane continued fulfilling his role with the Talamatis and sired multiple cubs, including two young males. By 2021, a significant shift occurred when the S8 Male began moving southward, challenging Dark Mane’s hold over the pride. The S8 Male succeeded in mating with three of the five adult Talamati lionesses. The remaining two older lionesses stayed with Dark Mane and the sub-adults, including the young males he had fathered. This period marked the beginning of the decline of Dark Mane’s influence over the Talamati Pride.",

This event marked the beginning of a division within the pride, ultimately leading to the formation of the Talamati Breakaway Pride. Over the year, the pride suffered key losses: a sub-adult female and a sub-adult male disappeared under unknown circumstances. By early 2022, the pride adopted a more nomadic lifestyle, likely driven by scarcity of large prey within their traditional territory and a lack of a strong dominant male to protect them. During this nomadic phase, another female was believed to have been killed by the [Plains Camp males](https://thewildlion.org/lions/The-Plains-Camp-Males) in April 2022. Four younger adult females accepted the S8 Male as their dominant male, while the two oldest females and remaining sub-adults did not accept S8, leading a semi-nomadic life that eventually became fully nomadic. By 2023, the splintered groups had taken new directions. The two oldest females from the original pride died. The four younger females, having moved south to southern Sabi Sands, came under the protection of the [Gijima Males](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Gijima-Coalition) and established themselves as a new pride, the Msuthlu Pride. Under the reign of the S8 Male, three adult females died unexpectedly. This left only one female with cubs/sub-adults, but the situation worsened with S8’s death. Following his death, all of S8’s remaining offspring eventually perished, marking the collapse of that lineage in the northern region. In 2024, local lodges and Panthera officially renamed the Talamati Breakaway Pride to the Talamati Pride and designated the group of four southern lionesses as the Msuthlu Pride.",

        "paragraph": "After years of dealing with a revolving door of dominant males, the arrival of the Birmingham males from the north was a welcome change. This coalition of four males began intruding into Kambula pride territory in 2017 and eventually settled there in 2018. From mid-2018 to mid-2019, five females gave birth to offspring sired by the Birmingham males, while the sixth female was suspected to be infertile, having yet to produce a litter despite mating with different males over the years. Under the Birmingham males’ dominance, the pride of six females rapidly grew to over 20 members, becoming the super pride of Sabi Sands. In 2020, as the first generation of Birmingham males neared independence, some females returned to estrus and produced a second generation of Birmingham offspring during 2020 and 2021. The first generation of Birmingham males included six males and a single female who reached adulthood. By this time, the Birmingham males had been reduced to just two and faced increasing pressure from neighboring coalitions such as the Northern Avocas and the lone Othawa male. The pride came into regular contact with these neighboring coalitions; two females accepted Northern Avocas, which further destabilized the pride. Consequently, most cubs from the second Birmingham generation did not survive long. In late 2021, the Birmingham males’ dominance suffered a major blow when four Ndhzenga males from the south invaded their territory. The Birmingham male known as “Tinyo” disappeared during this time, believed to have been killed in the conflict. The last remaining Birmingham male, “Nhenha,” soon went nomadic as the Ndhzenga males pushed out all competing coalitions from the area.",

It is believed one Birmingham male was killed during this invasion, leaving the sole remaining male no option but to vacate the territory. The pride split into two factions to protect the young Birmingham offspring. As of 2025, the Ndzhenga males dominate both factions of the original Kambula pride. The main Kambula pride has once again grown past 20 members, similar to the early days under the Birmingham males—an indication of the stability brought by the Ndzhenga coalition. This pride currently consists of five adult females, 11 sub-adults, and four cubs. The second faction, now known as the “Ntsevu” pride, is also under Ndzhenga control and comprises three adult females and three cubs. There are no obvious threats to the Ndzhenga coalition’s reign at present, but this could change soon.",

During the reign of the legendary West Street Males, the Castleton Pride flourished, producing strong generations of cubs and establishing a bloodline that left a deep imprint on the region. The Ximhungwe Pride began its rise in 2004, when six lionesses from the Castleton Pride came under the leadership of a male known as the Sand River Male or Dzunani. Under his guidance, the pride quickly became productive, with 18 cubs born between 2004 and 2005. However, scarcity of food and the pride's size made survival difficult. The number of cubs dropped to 16, then 12, and the lionesses were frequently seen in poor condition, recovering only temporarily after large kills. As the pride spent less time on Castleton property and more in the surrounding open grasslands, it was renamed after the area it now occupied: Ximhungwe.",

These Mapogo males had established dominance over the western sector, and Ximhungwe territory fell within their sphere of influence. At this stage, the pride consisted of five lionesses, but only one was fully mature. By late 2009 and into the early 2010s, the young Ximhungwe lionesses had finally reached reproductive maturity. After nearly two years under the control of the four western Mapogo males, they gave birth to their first litters, with at least six cubs born during this period. The lionesses, now fully matured, were beginning to fulfill their role as mothers. In mid-2010, following the death of Kinky Tail at the hands of the Majingilane coalition, Mr. T rejoined his Mapogo brothers in the west. Mr. T had not sired the new cubs nor was he familiar with the western pride structure or its offspring. Shortly after his arrival, the Ximhungwe cubs began to disappear. The timing and circumstances strongly suggest that Mr. T killed the cubs—a tragic but not uncommon behavior in lion dynamics when unfamiliar males join a pride with existing offspring. The young lionesses had just begun their journey of motherhood, only to be forced back into estrus by the loss of their litters. This act of infanticide shocked those who had followed the pride’s struggle to recover and earned Mr. T the chilling nickname “Satan.” It underscored the ruthless nature of lion hierarchy, where even cubs of one’s own coalition can be killed if not directly sired or recognized. In November 2011, tragedy struck again when the Castleton/Ximhungwe matriarch—the last original adult lioness of the pride and mother of the “Mini-Pogs”—was found caught in a snare. Despite all adversities, four cubs of the core Ximhungwe pride survived into early 2012. By 2012, the winds of change were on the horizon with the arrival of a new coalition to challenge the three remaining Mapogo males.",

Their relationship with the Ximhungwe lionesses was strained from the start. Still traumatized by previous cub losses during the Mapogo era, the lionesses worked hard to keep their cubs hidden and away from the Selati males. One of the Selati males stood out for his aggression and independence; he even chased the Ximhungwe lionesses at one point and was attacked by all four females. Despite their valiant defense, the Ximhungwe lionesses were unable to protect their offspring. The last four Mapogo cubs disappeared by mid-2012, forcing the lionesses to start over. New litters sired by the Selatis were born in late 2012 and early 2013. By early 2013, two lionesses had introduced their cubs to the new males. The Selati males were beginning to behave like pride males—feeding with the pride and patrolling regularly. However, the Selati males soon abandoned the pride, shifting their focus to the Othawa pride, partly due to pressure from the Majingilane coalition just east of their territory. By the end of the Selati era, the pride was left with only four surviving sub-adults. This marked the beginning of a long period of wandering and instability for the Ximhungwe lionesses, left without protection or consistent territory. Only three sub-adults survived to adulthood—two females and one male—all sired by the Selati males.",

In early 2017, reports from Manyeleti identified three mature individuals—a limping male and two lionesses. Later that year, the male split from his sisters and likely passed away, leaving the two lionesses to roam Manyeleti and northern Sabi Sands. By November 2018, the pride was recorded as consisting of two adult lionesses, both confirmed daughters of the Selati males. In 2019, the pride became fully nomadic, moving through the western and northern sectors of Sabi Sands and even venturing outside the reserve, reflecting their continued instability and lack of secure territory. In January 2020, one lioness gave birth, offering hope for the lineage. However, tragedy struck when her sister—already in declining health—separated and eventually passed away. Consequently, the pride was reduced to a single adult lioness, the sole bearer of the Ximhungwe legacy. In early 2022, the lone Ximhungwe female was seen again in the western sector, this time accompanied by Gingerella, a lioness formerly associated with the [Othawa Pride](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Othawa-Pride). The Othawa Pride, now with new cubs, rejected her. Gingerella remained alone in the west before eventually joining the last surviving Ximhungwe lioness.",

A month later, in September 2023, the older Ximhungwe lioness gave birth to a single male cub, sired by the same coalition. Unfortunately, the young male did not survive long. Despite her loss, the Ximhungwe lioness continued to nurse and protect Gingerella’s cubs, offering both maternal care and safety, which delayed her return to estrus until late 2024. Though they were not her biological daughters, she invested fully in their survival, development, and pride unity. Once reduced to a single lioness, the Ximhungwe pride was finally flourishing again. In late April 2025, the last of the original Ximhungwe pride was killed by hyenas after being seen with a severe injury. She had recently given birth to two young male cubs who are now dependent on the rest of the pride for survival. This leaves the pride with just one lone lioness, Gingerella, to raise the young of the pride, which currently consists of two female sub-adults and a remaining single young male cub of the Ximhungwe lioness.

However, a major shift occurred when the Mapogo coalition launched a territorial takeover. The Mapogos were infamous for their aggression and their effectiveness at eliminating rival males. During their invasion, Blondie was killed, and several cubs were lost due to infanticide, a common behavior after male takeovers that brings females back into estrus.

The young male did his best to fight off the two attackers but never stood a chance against the two experienced males. Mr T and Kinky Tail suffered superficial injuries from the fight but had achieved their goal, the Majingilane coalition was now down to just four members."

As if the four Majingilane males were looking to avenge the loss, a second confrontation occurred between the two coalitions. According to ranger Peter Rundle from Nkorho, Kinky Tail showed up alone and despite his injuries, charged and chased the four Majingilane all by himself, however, his rivals eventually turned to face him. The young males quickly managed to overpower the overconfident Kinky Tail and pinned him to the ground. The attack was brutal and intense, Kinky Tail was brutally mauled by the four males and by the time Mr. T arrived on the scene, it was already too late. Mr. T still attempted to take on a few Majingilane but was ultimately forced to flee for his life. The four Majingilanes chased Mr. T but luckily he managed to get away, after this the Majingilanes went back to finish off what was left of Kinky Tail, his body was brutally attacked and partially cannibalized by the Majingilane males. Just like that, the Mapogos had lost their eastern territory and all the prides that were in it to the Majingilane males."

        "paragraph": "After losing his territory, Mr. T was seen in the western sector trying to join his remaining four brothers. The Majingilane males quickly ate away the eastern part of the Mapogos territory and took over the prides after killing all Mapogo offspring. In the western sector, the four Mapogo brothers were still dominant males with a huge territory and multiple prides to protect. Mr. T was reluctantly allowed to join back by his brothers. Due to the split, Mr. T did not see many of the cubs as his since he hadn’t been in the western portion of the territory for years. Mr.T killed cubs fathered by his brothers with the Ximunghwe pride, a pride he wasn’t familiar with at all. In the grand scheme, Mr. T joining back with his brothers was a setback for the Mapogo legacy and net negative for their bloodline. There aren’t many other recorded instances of a coalition rejoining after the split so it's unclear how lions usually behave in such a scenario."

In late 2010, Pretty Boy and Rasta were seen in the Eastern Sector of Sabi Sand but only an injured Pretty Boy returned. The two brothers had clearly come into contact with other lions which ultimately led to complete disappearance of Rasta, possibly at the hands of the Majingilane males. The Mapogos suffered yet another loss when Dreadlocks also suddenly disappeared within the next year, leaving just three Mapogos. The three remaining brothers were no longer in their prime and it was inevitable that a young coalition would soon pop up and try to oust the aging Mapogos."

At this time, the Mapogos were still dominant over the Ximhungwe and Othawa prides. In 2011, a coalition of four young males known as the Selati males pushed into Mapogo territory. The Mapogos drove the young coalition out of their territory and back out into the southern regions of Sabi Sand for the remainder of the year. In early 2012, the Mapogo territory was yet again invaded by the same four males, an altercation was inevitable. In March of 2012, the young Selati males successfully caught Mr. T. Despite being cornered by the four Selati males and having no support from his two brothers, Mr. T fought back and was viciously mauled by the young males in the process. After Mr. After T's death, the remaining two Mapogos became nomads. Being old and without a pride to keep them fed, the males rapidly lost condition and it was obvious that the end wasn’t too far away. The last sightings of the Mapogo males were in early 2013."

There was also believed to be atleast one female fathered by the Mapogos in the Sparta pride that made it to adulthood but the pride died out in 2023. A substantial loss was the Sand River pride, the pride was flourishing and had a decent number of Mapogos offspring that were nearing adulthood. The pride escaped the reserve repeatedly, allegedly due to pressure from the Mapogos themselves, and was euthanized. Despite their spotty success as fathers, the Mapogo bloodline runs through many of the prides in Sabi Sands and their legacy lives on."

    "intro": "The Majingilane coalition was a group of five male lions that initially gained notoriety through their appearance in the famous wildlife documentary, Brothers in Blood: The Lions of the Sabi Sand. The origins of the Majingilane coalition are traced to a pride in the Kruger National Park, though a lot isn’t known about their early history or nomadic journey. They first appeared in Sabi Sands in late 2009 as young nomads in the territory of the two younger [Mapogos](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Mapogo-Coalition) who were dominant in the eastern part of the Mapogo territory at that point. The story of the Majingilane and Mapogo coalitions became tales of legends and inspired a whole generation of nature enthusiasts to start following the social dynamics of lions. The males were called “Darkmane”, the leader of the group with a noticeable dark mane, “Scar Nose”, the male easily identifiable from his uniquely scarred nose, “Hip Scar”, the male with the scar on his left hip, “Golden Mane”, the male with the golden and blonde mane, and the one known as the “fifth Majingilane”, the male that was killed in the confrontation with the Mapogo males. This coalition went on to become legendary in Sabi Sands as very successful territorial males and have left a huge legacy through their countless offspring which they sired in their 8 year long reign.",

        "paragraph": "In mid 2010, the young Majingilane males came face to face with the two aggressive males known as Mr. T and Kinky Tail who were dominant in the eastern side of Sabi Sands. These two males were part of the Mapogo coalition that was known to be unusually aggressive in terms of dealing with other territorial males and the Majingilane males were treated no different. The two Mapogos responded to the presence of the Majingilane coalition in very Mapogo fashion, by charging in and isolating one of the Majingilane males. The two males aggressively attacked the young male, the young male was pinned down and brutally mauled by the Mapogo males who eventually broke his spine. The other four Majingilane were unable to save their brother in time and were now down a member. At this point most nomadic coalitions would admit defeat and leave the area, but not these males. The four remaining males stayed in the area which led to another confrontation with Mapogo males that same day, Kinky Tail confidently charged the Majingilane males and found himself in the fight for his life against the four males who were unusually aggressive after the loss of their brother earlier in the day. The four males brutally attacked Kinky Tail and in minutes had his body ripped apart the same way it happened with their deceased brother. Mr. T eventually came to the aid of his brother but it was already too late, he could have potentially faced the same fate against the four males who were now full of confidence. Having lost his brother, Mr. T had no choice but to abandon his territory and leave the area. This was the brutal start of the Majingilane reign, they had just ousted two of the most notorious males to ever grace the Sabi Sands and became territorial males. It was as if they had avenged the loss of their brother, and made his sacrifice not go in vain."

        "paragraph": "After ousting the two Mapogos, the Majingilane males did not waste any time taking over the prides in the area. Their first target was the Tsalala Pride who at the time had Mapogo offspring to protect. The pride ended up splitting into two and the tailless Tsalala female left the pride along with the four young sub-adult females to raise them to adulthood away from the dangerous Majingilane males. By 2012, the Majingilane males had sired multiple litters of cubs with the Tsalala pride. Next was the natal pride of the Mapogo coalition, the Sparta Pride. The Majingilane males killed multiple members of the pride, a breakaway pride formed but the Majingilane males didn’t take too long to eliminate the remaining Mapogo offspring in the Sparta pride. According to Londolozi, by 2012 the Majingilane males had fathered at least 13 cubs with the Sparta pride of which 8 were still alive. They also became dominant over other prides in area such as the Fourways and [Styx](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Styx-Pride) prides during this early period, fathering litters with both prides that made it to adulthood. The Majingilane males were hugely successful as dominant males and were quick to deal with any intruders, ensuring the safety of the prides and cubs under their domain. They had fathered at least 4 cubs in the Fourways pride and 6 in the Styx pride by 2012. They were a stabilizing force for many of these prides who had suffered during the Mapogo years and lost multiple pride members and litters to them. The Majingilane years were a godsend for many of these prides, especially the Styx pride that had dealt with the onslaught and instability of the Mapogos for years.",

        "paragraph": "The first challenge of the Majingilane reign came in the form of the 5 Southern/Selati males that had started hanging around the area previously held by the Sparta pride. They were still young and didn’t pose much of a threat to the four Majingilane males who were in their absolute prime. The Selati males were playing with fire by staying in Majingilane territory and paid the inevitable price for it when one of the young males was caught and killed by the Majingilane coalition. This loss seemed enough to push the Selati males away to the western part of the Sabi Sands where they eventually became dominant after dethroning the aging Mapogo males in mid 2012. The next couple years didn’t see much friction between the two coalitions but that changed around late 2013 when the Majingilane males started making incursions into the Selati territory with a challenge seeming imminent. The tension resulted in the Majingilane males cornering and mauling one of the Selati males in early 2014, resulting in the Selati male being badly injured. Another Selati male had died just months earlier in 2013 due to a buffalo hunt gone wrong, the once promising coalition was down to just 2 healthy males and one injured male. By mid 2014, only 2 Selati males were left with the death of the injured Selati male, likely at the hands of the Majingilane coalition. This was a huge victory for the Majingilane males who were now getting close to no longer being in their prime, the western sector was the perfect territory for them since it was fenced from 3 sides. After ousting the Selati males, the Majingilane males took over the [Othawa pride](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Othawa-Pride) that was previously held by the Selatis and killed all the Selati offspring so they could father litters of their own."

        "paragraph": "As of 2012, the Majingilane males were very successful males with multiple prides and a large territory but they were ready to move on to new challenges. The Tsalala breakaway females which later became the [Mhangeni pride](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Mhangeni-Pride), had just reached breeding age and the Majingilane males were quick to capitalize. These were the same females that were once running from the Majingilane males since they were the offspring of the previous dominant males of the main Tsalala pride. This was a very fruitful partnership that spanned two generations and spawned a pride of 6 females that later became known as the [Kambula Pride](https://thewildlion.org/lions/Kambula-Pride) as well as a coalition of 3 males known as the Mhangeni males that dispersed into the Kruger. The fate of the second generation of Majingilane-Mhangeni was not as lucky, of the 12 sub-adults only 2 young females made it to adulthood and were able to join the main pride after struggling to survive as nomads. The rest of the sub-adults, including a promising coalition of 9 males, didn't make it out alive as they had essentially been prematurely abandoned by their mothers. The Mhangeni pride females had come into estrus but had no males to mate with as the Majingilane males had all died due to old age so they ended up abandoning the sub-adults to find new males to mate with. This was a tragic situation for the young sub-adults who did their best to survive but most of them were unequipped to deal with the challenges of nomadichood at such a young age. The Majingilane males also took over the Othawa pride in early 2014 after ousting the Selati males, fathering 2 males and at least a single female made it to adulthood. The Othawa and Mhangeni pride were great for the Majingilane legacy in Sabi Sands and added on to all the success they had in the first half of their dominance."

        "paragraph": "The biggest strength of the Majingilane coalition was their strong bond, they used it perfectly to drive their numerical advantage home against other coalitions. Being 4 males, they were rarely in a position where they didn’t have the numerical advantage and when that wasn’t the case, they were quick to retreat strategically. This was the secret to their success which helped them come out on top in countless altercations against other coalitions such as the Mapogos, the 6 Matimbas, and the 5 Selati’s which were all larger coalitions. The Majingilane dominance lasted over 8 years and all of them died due to old age except the 5th Majingilane that was killed by the Mapogo males in 2010, both of which are indicators of their longevity and continued success. One major confrontation that Majingilane males were involved in with other males was the alteration against the Mapogos around Elephant Planes which led to the disappearance of one Mapogo and injuring of another. Another memorable altercation happened between the Majingilane and the 2 Southern Matimbas around 2016, Londolozi covered this event in detail and it was proof that the Majingilane males were willing to fight for what was their's even in old age. There were more similar altercations with other males but the common theme among all of them was that the Majingilanes always came out on top in the long run."

        "paragraph": "The Majingilane males were special lions and it was obvious from the day they went up against the 2 Mapogos and refused to abandon the area despite the loss of a member. Once they secured a territory, they became successful dominant males that brought very needed stability and growth to many prides. After raising the first generation of their offspring, they ousted a young and prime coalition in the name of the Selati males and became territorial over the arguably best territory in all of Sabi Sands. The Majingilane bloodline lives on in many of the prides they were dominant over during their time and have left descendants all over the Sabi Sands and parts of the Kruger National Park. The Hip-Scarred male was the second Majingilane to die, his condition slowly worsened as he aged and his mobility was severely limited in his later life due to the injury. After his passing in 2017, the other 3 passed only a year later and all of them passed in their old age due to natural causes, in their own territory. This marked the end of a significant chapter in the history of Sabi Sands and set a very high bar for any future coalitions that might come through the Sabi Sands."
